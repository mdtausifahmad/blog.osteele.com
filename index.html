I published this blog from 2003 to 2008.
<p>

<p>
Maintaining it doubled as a means to keep up with server, web, and publishing technologies.
Over time it migrated from <a href="http://movabletype.org">Movable Type</a>,
to <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>,
to <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>,
back to Wordpress, to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://ruhoh.com">Ruhoh</a>,
and finally to <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> &mdash;
with unpublished attempts in <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> and <a href="http://zespia.tw/hexo/">Hexo</a>.
<p>

<p>
The software and projects described here have mostly been superceded,
and the thoughts seemed more original and interesting to me when the internet and I were both younger,
and fewer people had shared their experiences with programming, software engineering, and internet technologies.
Whenever I remove them people ask where they went, though.
So here they are.

The illustrations in my <a href='./posts/2008/05/my-git-workflow'>My Git Workflow</a>
have been adapted (with permission) and improved many times. You can find better versions, including interactive versions, elsewhere on the web.
