Method Software was a gaming company started by Steve Strassman.  I worked with Henry Minsky and Stacey Montgomery, picking up the reins from Carl Feynman.

The Method game engine was a distributed simulation environment for internet role-playing and social simulations, written in Java. I developed a Scheme-based interpreted simulation language (maybe the first Scheme interpreter for Java) and a battery of algorithms for implementing conversational agents.  Unofficial slogan: "Method, where people are objects too."

Method depended on there being a revenue subscription model for online games.  At the time, it looked like MSN and AOL might create this, but they didn't.  So we morphed the company into a consultancy for building consulting tools.  Unofficial slogan: "Putting the _fun_ back into simulated business negotiation training."
