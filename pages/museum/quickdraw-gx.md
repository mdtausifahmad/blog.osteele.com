### Quickdraw GX

![](http://osteele.com/museum/images/quickdraw-gx.gif)

[Quickdraw GX](http://developer.apple.com/macos/quickdrawgx.html) was an object-oriented device-independent 2D imaging library for the Macintosh, similar to Display Postscript or GDI+ but with a geometry engine, or to Java2D but a decade earlier.  It may have been the first graphics system to support perspective transformations, unicode, and international line layout on a desktop computer.

## Comments

GX wasn't just an imaging library, it was also a highly customizable printing architecture. The two were so tightly integrated that you got full WYSIWYG printing on both PostScript and non-PostScript printers.

The GX graphics architecture was not only very powerful, it was also very fast.
