Apple Cambridge in the early nineties created the [Dylan programming language](http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Programming/Languages/Dylan/?tc=1).  Dylan combined the power of functional programming languages such as Lisp, the object system from Simula and Smalltalk, and added an infix (Pascal-like) syntax; it was innovative in that it had a macro system that worked with the infix syntax.

(Image from [lemonodor](http://lemonodor.com).  Clicking on an object in one pane shows an aspect of that object, such as contents, callers, or variable references, in any pane that is linked to it.)

I was the project lead for the [Apple Dylan](http://monday.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/AppleDylanEulogy) development environment, which took some of the browsers ideas from Smalltalk but made them [configurable](http://www.dylanpro.com/picts/dylanProjectBrowser.gif).  You could create multiple panes, place an object such as a source project, source file, method, or variable in one pane, and link it to other panes, with different link types such as "source for", "contents of", "methods that reference", "methods that write", or "callers".  See [Paul R. Potts's wiki](http://monday.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/AppleDylan) for screen shots [here](http://monday.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/AppleDylanScreenShotsBrowsers) and [here](http://monday.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/AppleDylanScreenshots)

The [Dylan Exchange](http://www.dylanpro.com/DylanExchange.html) <strike>and Functional Objects</strike> are still carrying the Dylan torch.

I loved Dylan! And the browser. Great work that the rest of the world still hasn't caught up to.
