    Jenny said something to me about a year ago that I find somewhat profound, even though maybe it's not: there are two kinds of people: those who define themselves by what they consume, and those who define themselves by what they produce.

    Obviously, all of us are the second kind, and, tacitly but obviously, we find that far superior in both a practical and a moral sense.

    I think that's a very important value of our group, one that is so much in the air we breathe that we never even think to express it explicitly.

RIP, [DLW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Weinreb).
